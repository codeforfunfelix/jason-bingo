A simple website that lets you create custom Bingo cards for any occasion.

## How to Use

To start, click the "Create New Project" button. You can give your project a name by clicking on the header. Once you've got everything set up, you can begin adding items. When you have enough items to completely fill a standard 5x5 Bingo Board (24, or 25 with no free space), you can click the "Export" button to generate as many cards as you want.
